# Project Overview

We’re developing a pretty and accurate reconstruction of the medieval/postapocalyptic science fiction setting as a first-person [archviz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_rendering) [walking simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_simulator), focused on spatial exploration.

Current platform is PC from Unreal Engine 5.5 (so a port to other systems would be possible, if anyone wants to do it).

## Setting and Backstory

_Anathem_ is set on the fictional planet of Arbre. This planet’s intellectuals (theoretical scientists, mathematicians, philosophers …) live in "concents" (monastic communities) to separate their activities from secular society. They are banned from possessing or operating most technology. They chose to only communicate with the outside world once either every year, decade, century, or millennium, depending on the particular vows they have taken.

## Visual Design

Like a proper archaeological reconstruction, we will identify visually which parts are factual (derived from the source text), and which parts are only conjecture.

The buildings will be styled like simplified, white architectural models. (This project originated for #blocktober 2024, after all.) For mood and atmosphere, landscape/terrain and vegetation/foliage will use free assets, and lighting will be as photorealistic as possible.


# Gameplay / Level

For the time being, we are limiting ourselves to the "concent of Saunt Edhar" as perceived from a "fraa" (friar") of the Decenarian Math (those who stay isolated from outside world for 10 years). This means that the player can explore the Decenarian Math and the areas of the Mynster (church-like structure) usually accessible to those fraas.

For description and inspiration, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/Cinewulf/Anathem-3D/wiki).

As a "stretch goal" exploring the novel’s world on an Decennial Apert (opening of the Year and Decade Gates), the player would be able to explore also the Unarian (1-year) Math and the town around the concent (which will only be very, very roughly layed out).

# Mechanics

- first-person movement
- no objects
  - stretch goal: limited interaction (picking up, examining, dropping) of props from actual story at their locations in story
- stretch goal: voice-over audio description of/for selected areas/objects from audiobook version (if license attainable)
